# Belgica antarctica Amplicon-seq phylogeography

This repository contains additional supplementary material of the manuscript:
Genetic history, structure and gene flow among populations of *Belgica antarctica*, the only free-living insect in the western Antarctic Peninsula.

It contains:
- R scripts for the analysis presented on Supplemental Information 1.I, 1.III, 1.IV, and 1.VI;
- The primer sequences used with the amplicon-sequencing;
- The refence sequence used with PypeAmplicon pipeline (a fasta file containing the targeted amplicon sequences);
- The genomic coordidates of the SNPs and the amplicons as BED files;
